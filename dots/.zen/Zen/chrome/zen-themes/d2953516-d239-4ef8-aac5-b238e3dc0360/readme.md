# ðŸŽ¨ PywalZen

By using some native color variables, this theme makes [Pywalfox](https://github.com/Frewacom/pywalfox) work with [Zen](https://zen-browser.app/) Browser correctly.

> **NOTE**: Zen Browser implemented custom gradients for each workspace. While this theme works, you need to tweak the contrast for Zen to recognize it, just the first time. It is compatible with gradients and the new grain effect!

> **CAUTION**: Use this exclusively with Pywalfox, if not the theme will look wrong causing unreadable text and other issues.

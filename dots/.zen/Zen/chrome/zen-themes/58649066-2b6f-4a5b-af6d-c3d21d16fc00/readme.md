# Private Browsing Mode Highlighting

Any Zen window in private browsing mode isn't obviously indicated by default. This theme fixes that.

## What this theme does.

By default, this theme:

* Highlights the toolbar of a private browsing window with a purple gradient.
* Adds a purple border surrounding the page.
* Adds a private browsing icon to the right of the refresh button.

It also comes with the following settings:

* Replace the gradient with a solid purple color.
* Remove the background color entirely.
* Remove the purple border that surrounds the page.
* Changes the purple highlight color to either match Zen's theme color, or a custom color of your choice.
* Hide the private browsing icon.

These settings can be found in Zen's browser settings, in the 'Zen Mods' tab.
